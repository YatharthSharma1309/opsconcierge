# OpsConcierge — Product Vision

**Brand:** OpsConcierge  
**Codebase:** `OpsConcierge-App` (package: `opsconcierge`; formerly Relay AI)  
**Live:** **https://support-ai-nine-mu.vercel.app** (public) · https://relay-ai-app.vercel.app (login-walled)  
**Real-world playbook:** [`REAL_WORLD_USE.md`](./REAL_WORLD_USE.md)

## What it is

OpsConcierge is an **ops desk for small businesses** — not a generic chatbot.

It stops founders from re-answering the same billing/returns/hours questions, hands messy cases to a human **with the full transcript**, and helps the same person shortlist hires from resumes that arrive over email or WhatsApp — with auditable support runs and evidence-backed hiring decisions.

## Who it's for (real ICP)

| Buyer | Situation | Why they care |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Founder / ops lead (5–50 people)** | Still owns inbox + hiring | One tool for weekly ops repeats |
| **D2C / Shopify brands** | WISMO, returns, shipping eat the week | Deflect policy FAQs on-site |
| **Early SaaS** | Password/how-to/billing tickets | Docs → answers → ticket with context |
| **Local services / tutoring** | Hours, booking FAQs + occasional hiring | Website FAQ + tutor/tech resume inbox |

**Not v1:** Enterprise ITSM, call-center ACD, or “90% autonomous support” claims.

## Product structure

```
Company memory (FAQs, SOPs, policies)
        │
        ├─► Support concierge: Widget → RAG answer → Escalate → Ticket → Execution log
        │
        └─► Hiring concierge: Role brief → Resume intake → Ranked shortlist → Interview prep
                    (founder posts jobs on Indeed/LinkedIn/referrals — outside the app)
```

### Support lane (primary)

**Real path:** Website chat is where SMBs put self-serve; email remains for disputes.

1. Upload the docs you already have (Notion export, PDF policy, FAQ).
2. Customer asks on the embeddable widget.
3. AI answers **from your docs only**.
4. One-click escalate → ticket with transcript (customers insist on a human option).
5. Review execution log weekly → fix the knowledge base.

### Hiring lane (secondary, same workspace)

**Real path:** Referrals + free Indeed/LinkedIn; founders drown in PDFs.

1. Define must-haves.
2. Upload resumes from any channel.
3. AI ranks with evidence — **never auto-rejects**.
4. Draft interview questions / scorecard hints.
5. Founder confirms hire/reject.

## Design-partner personas

See full detail in [`REAL_WORLD_USE.md`](./REAL_WORLD_USE.md):

| Persona | Vertical | Hero use |
|---------|----------|----------|
| GlowTheory | D2C skincare | Returns / shipping FAQ widget |

## Honest success bar

| Metric | Realistic first 90 days |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Support deflection | 40–60% of routine FAQs (not 90%) |
| Escalation | Always available; ~25–40% to human is healthy |
| Hiring time saved | ~4–6 hours/hire on screening + question prep |
| Ops hygiene | Weekly log review → KB updates (prevents bot abandonment) |
